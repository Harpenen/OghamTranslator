# OghamTranslator
A simple Ogham translator I made a while ago. (‎February ‎12, ‎2022)
# This doesn't translate actual language, it just replaces symbols back and forth. From what I can tell, that's what all the ogham translators online do to, because no one is offering translations for some old unused version of irish.
